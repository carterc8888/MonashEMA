# MonashEMA

In this assignment (FIT2095), developed as a collaborative effort between myself and my teammate, Zecan Liu, we are tasked with implementing persistent data storage for the Events Management Application (EMA) using MongoDB. The transition involves replacing the initial array of objects with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, facilitated by the use of Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library.

Our collaboration aims to ensure that the EMA app achieves persistent storage in MongoDB, improving data consistency and reliability. Additionally, we will jointly work on serving clients with JSON data, adhering to modern web development practices. Finally, deploying the EMA app to a cloud provider will be a shared responsibility, ensuring accessibility and scalability for a wider audience. This group assignment is designed to simulate real-life industry scenarios, promoting collaborative work dynamics.
